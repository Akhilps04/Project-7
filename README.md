# Project-7
An autoencoder model trained on the MNIST dataset to reconstruct handwritten digits, showcasing unsupervised deep learning and dimensionality reduction techniques.
# Project Overview
This project utilizes an autoencoder to reconstruct handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to compress and reconstruct image data efficiently, leveraging unsupervised learning principles. The autoencoder successfully demonstrates its ability to learn a meaningful compressed representation of the input data.

# Dataset
Name: MNIST Handwritten Digits
Details: Includes 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9).
Training samples: 60,000
Testing samples: 10,000

# Training Performance
Epochs: 25
Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Results:
Training Loss: Converged to ~0.073
Validation Loss: Converged to ~0.073, closely matching training loss (no overfitting detected).

# Visual Results
Reconstructed Images:
The reconstructed images closely resemble the original images, preserving essential details while slightly smoothing some edges.
For example, digits like "2" and "7" retain clear outlines post-reconstruction.
Loss Graph:
The training and validation loss decrease steadily over epochs, confirming stable learning behavior.

# Strengths
High Reconstruction Accuracy: Achieved ~99.80% average pixel accuracy.
Efficient Compression: Encodes 784 input pixels into a latent vector of 64 dimensions, significantly reducing the data size.
Generalizability: Performance on test data matches training results, demonstrating robustness.

# Potential Applications
Image Compression: Reducing image file sizes while retaining quality.
Denoising Autoencoders: Removing noise from corrupted images (future extension).
Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns in image data.

# Limitations
The model is trained only on MNIST digits, limiting its application to similar datasets.
Small reconstruction errors are visible, especially in fine details.

# Future Enhancements
Train on diverse datasets like Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10.
Develop denoising capabilities to handle noisy images.
Use the latent representations for downstream tasks like clustering.
